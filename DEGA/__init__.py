================================================================

**Differential gene expression analysis** is an important tool
for identifying genes that display a significantly altered expression
in response to specific stimuli.
**DEGA** is a Python package for differential expression analysis.
It is an implementation of the core algorithm of the R package DESeq2.
Along with the differential testing algorithm,
DEGA also provides high-level functions for **dataset exploration**
and **results interpretation**.
